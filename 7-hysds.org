  - Internal Wiki
  - External Wiki
- People are looking for
  - FAQs
    - Go through the documentation
    - Every time you have a question, put it in this Google Doc
    - This can be the basis for your FAQ
  - Guides
  - Getting Started
- Give people tasks like "write this document" rather than "document this
  feature"
  - (I guess having an infrastructure)
- Tagging structure
  - Tag labels
    - delete
    - create_content
    - unfinished
    - in_progress
    - needs_update
    - ok
  - Created a landing page listing out all the articles which have those tags
    (kind of like a dashboard for the different areas)
- Getting outside contribution
  - Fixing the internal documentation first by making sure the onboarding docs
    are up to date
  - Only then do you bring in outside contributors
