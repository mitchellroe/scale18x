# GitLab Community Day

- Gitter is part of the GitLab project, apparently.
  https://gitter.im/gitlabhq/contributors
- GitLab quarterly hackathon
- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/education-program/
- GitLab for Education is free for student use. We could totally use this for
  our students to have an internal communication / code repository / study area.
- The higher versions are available for free to Open-Source companies
